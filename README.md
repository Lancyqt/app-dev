# Suicide Squad (2016) Movie Review

## Directed by: David Ayer

*Suicide Squad* is a superhero movie from DC Comics. It’s about a group of villains who are forced to work together on a dangerous mission to save the world. They have to stop a powerful witch, **Enchantress**, from destroying everything.

### Main Characters:
- **Harley Quinn**: Played by *Margot Robbie*, she's a crazy and fun character who loves the Joker.
- **Deadshot**: Played by *Will Smith*, he’s a skilled shooter and a dad trying to do better.
- **The Joker**: Played by *Jared Leto*, he's Harley’s boyfriend and a dangerous criminal.
- **El Diablo**: Played by *Jay Hernandez*, he can control fire and has a sad backstory.

### Plot

The movie follows a team of bad guys who are sent on a mission by the government. They have to stop **Enchantress**, a powerful witch who is trying to take over the world. While trying to save the world, they also have to deal with their own issues and fight a lot of enemies.

### What I Liked:
- The movie is full of action, with a lot of cool scenes.
- Harley Quinn is really fun to watch and her crazy personality makes the movie interesting.
- The characters all have unique powers and personalities, which makes the squad dynamic fun.

### What Could Be Better:
- The movie’s tone feels a little weird at times. Sometimes it’s funny, then it tries to be serious, and it doesn’t always work.
- The villain, **Enchantress**, isn’t that great. She doesn’t feel like a strong threat compared to the team.

### Rating:
**4.5/5** – It's a fun movie, but it could have been better with a stronger story and villain.

**Final Thoughts**: *Suicide Squad* is a cool movie if you like action and characters with attitude, but it doesn't have the best story.
